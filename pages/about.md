The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a premier robotics program that challenges high school students to design, build, and program robots to compete in an exciting annual game. Founded in 1989 by inventor Dean Kamen, FIRST—an acronym for “For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology”—aims to inspire a passion for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) among young people.

Every year, teams of students, mentors, and volunteers come together to tackle a unique challenge that combines engineering skills with creativity. The competition typically kicks off with a kickoff event, where teams receive the game rules and specifications for the robot they’ll need to build. With a tight timeline—usually around six weeks—teams brainstorm designs, develop strategies, and work collaboratively to construct their robots. This intense build season not only hones their technical skills but also fosters teamwork, problem-solving, and project management abilities.

Once the build period concludes, teams take their robots to regional competitions and, potentially, the championship. During these events, robots compete in a series of matches, often in alliances with other teams, showcasing their capabilities and strategic thinking. The atmosphere is electric, filled with excitement, camaraderie, and a shared passion for robotics. Teams cheer for each other and celebrate not just victories but the spirit of collaboration that FIRST promotes.

Beyond the technical aspects, FRC emphasizes the importance of gracious professionalism—a core value that encourages teams to compete fiercely while treating each other with respect and kindness. This focus on character development is one of the distinguishing features of the competition, helping students grow as individuals and teammates.

Moreover, FIRST Robotics has a significant impact on the community. Teams often engage in outreach programs, sharing their knowledge and enthusiasm for robotics with younger students and inspiring the next generation of innovators. By participating in local events and workshops, teams help foster a culture of learning and curiosity.

The experience gained from FRC can be transformative, with many participants going on to pursue careers in STEM fields. Colleges and universities recognize the value of this hands-on experience, often offering scholarships and admissions advantages to students involved in FIRST. 

In summary, the FIRST Robotics Competition is more than just a robotics contest; it’s a celebration of innovation, teamwork, and community spirit. By combining technical challenges with life skills, FRC equips students with the tools they need to succeed, both in the realm of robotics and beyond. It’s a place where young minds can thrive, creating a brighter future for all.

The TeraViks, Team 9044, exemplify the core values of the FIRST Robotics Competition through their commitment to collaboration, innovation, and community engagement. Since their inception, the TeraViks have approached each build season with a blend of enthusiasm and creativity, gathering diverse talents to brainstorm and tackle the unique challenges presented each year. Their robots reflect not just technical skills but also the teamwork and problem-solving abilities cultivated through countless hours of collaboration. Beyond building robots, the TeraViks are passionate about outreach, regularly hosting workshops and events for local schools to inspire younger students in STEM. This dedication to mentorship fosters a love for robotics in the next generation, aligning perfectly with FIRST’s mission to cultivate a passion for science and technology. At competitions, the TeraViks embody gracious professionalism, supporting their alliance partners and treating fellow competitors with respect, creating a spirit of camaraderie that enriches the entire robotics community. Through their journey, the TeraViks not only compete fiercely but also build connections that extend well beyond the field, leaving a positive mark on both their local community and the broader FIRST network.
